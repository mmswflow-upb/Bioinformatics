Each point in the plot represents one viral genome.

The X-axis shows the genome’s overall GC% (Cytosine + Guanine content).

The Y-axis shows the assembly time in milliseconds measured during the reconstruction process from simulated reads.

The position of each point depends on both the GC composition and the genome’s complexity:

Horizontal differences (along the X-axis)

Viruses with a low GC% are located more to the left of the plot, while those with a high GC% are toward the right.

GC content influences the sequence composition and the variety of k-mers in the genome, which can affect how repetitive or unique the sequence is.

Vertical differences (along the Y-axis)

The assembly time depends mostly on the genome length and the number of unique k-mers generated during the assembly process.

Longer genomes or genomes with more repetitive regions tend to produce more nodes and edges in the de Bruijn graph, requiring more computation and resulting in higher points (longer times).

Shorter or less complex genomes assemble faster and therefore appear lower on the plot.

Overall interpretation

There isn’t always a direct correlation between GC% and assembly time; genomes with similar GC% values may still differ in assembly time because of differences in length, structure, or repeat content.

Clusters or trends in the plot can hint at how sequence composition (GC%) interacts with computational complexity (assembly time).

In summary, the points differ in position because of the combined influence of genome size, GC composition, and sequence complexity—factors that affect how quickly and efficiently each viral genome can be assembled.
